# Tab Navigation - About Me App

In Module 1, you created the About Me web app. Here, you will create the same app for a phone. Use all the same contents -- text, list of skills, and picture and info about the school. You will use tab navigation to move from screen to screen. Add custom fonts, as you did in the project for the Course List. Here is an example -- note the tabs on the bottom, which contain icons as well as text:

![tab-1.PNG](https://github.com/bell-kevin/aboutMeApp/blob/main/pics/tab-1.PNG)     ![tab-2.PNG](https://github.com/bell-kevin/aboutMeApp/blob/main/pics/tab-2.PNG)     ![tab-3.PNG](https://github.com/bell-kevin/aboutMeApp/blob/main/pics/tab-3.PNG)

 

Use a ScrollView to display the elements in the array of lists. Put the image of the school in local assets. Create a "screens" folder and put all the screen components there. Include a background color on all pages.

The tabs at the bottom have icons from Ionicons -- these are named "home", "list", and "school". You may use other icons from any icon library available. The project also uses custom fonts. In the example, these are the same custom fonts used in the project for Course List, but you may use different custom font(s).

 

Take 3 screenshots, as shown above.

Submission: Zip together the root folder and the 3 screenshots, and submit the single zipped folder.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
